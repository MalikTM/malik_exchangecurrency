# malik_exchangecurrency
Some RedM Servers underestimate the value of "Rols" in the game. It can be very useful to create RP, so I decided to create an Exchange Currency to let people use this new currency. Enjoy!

Import it on your server resources folder.
Go to your server.cfg

Write down your resources:
ensure malik_exchangecurrency

ENJOY!
